# Geofencing-Attendance-Application
The Android-based Geofencing Attendance App simplifies attendance tracking with geolocation and facial recognition. Teachers set a geofenced area, like a classroom or campus, and students can only mark attendance within it. This ensures accuracy and prevents proxy attendance, ideal for educational institutions.
